## Cruise Control

Cruise Control is used to automate the dynamic workload rebalance and self-healing of a Kafka cluster. This tool will allow you to add, replace or remove nodes and the cluster will be automatically adjusted. Partitions will be rebalanced based on resource usage.

The default configuration has self healing enabled.
